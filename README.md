This project is a Dashboard using Twitter to :
- Get the top trending topics in [France]
- Get data about a selected topic, top tweets, graphs about the topic, etc

## Build Setup

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequites

Install __[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)__. 

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

### Run the app

To run the app on your local machine you will need 2 terminals.

In the first one, run :

``` bash
# starts the back on port 3000
npm run serve
```

And in the seconde one :

You can then go to localhost:8080 to see your DashBoard.
